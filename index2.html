      <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Hey Momo !<br>
      First Things First! A very very very very Happy Birthday to my baby!! When we met ik you were just like lol another fuckboii!! he won't be any different? But me thought the opposite. I found that one girl out of thousands or maybe ten thousands who's mature, has brains, is hot and thick also:P <br>
      As we started hanging out more, I had this feeling that I should try more and not just ignore. Idk what attracted me, maybe the mindset? maybe the maturity? thickness? yusss deff. But I was attracted. <br>
      After 165000 mails, Anusmita got to know this guy is different :P !! Things started to get good after that. Idk if you'll believe or not but I would have been a depressed mess if I would not have had met you. You came in my life at the right time when I had already seen the worse and another was on the way :(<br>
      I cannot thank you enough for being there w me everytime I needed. You ask me no? maine kya kr h aisa jo tu itna krta h mere liye. If tu na hoti, mere pass koi na hota to share my stuff, to stop me from crying. Thankyou for being there for me always.
      As time passed by, we came close. And that Hot Saturday, too Close?:P Wild it was. First time that too in car Lolzz. <br>
      Then you always came out even if aunty hote the tb bhi you came many times to meet me. Thankyou for that again. I love hanging out with you. It's like I've got the best company guysss. You can see that on my face no? Always smiling and happy when momo around.<br>
      My friends also liked you. Not a single person has said achi ni h. Bolenge b kaise, momo best no?:) <br>
      I am always surprised itni similarities kaise ho skti h in 2 different people but it is true in our case and I love it. Opposites attract my foot:)<br>
      Meko nhi chahiye tha that you go to college in january and see God listened. <br>
      Valentines day pe when I gave you the pendant, I literally did not expect aisa reaction monkey jaisa. But it was so cute and you looked like a baby. So So happy. Crazy Monkey vibes you were giving hehe!
      I was scared tujhe psnd aayega ki nhi but you loved it and I was so happy and relieved. <br>
      Heart talks time ok? <br>
      Everyone needs a support ok? Even me who has seen these worst things. I need support always. And I am happy that I can be one for you. I don't want you to ever feel alone ok? Me here anytime you need as always. You have been a constant motivation. tu na hoti toh maybe I wouldn't have even started trying to get better, get good things in life. You made me feel that I deserve more and I thankyou for that. I want you to be like this always with me and not change ever please. You deserve all the happiness in the world<br>
      One more thing - I can proudly say that my first time was better than most right hehe? The hotness level was at the top. Keeping my shyness aside, I do want more and more and more heads more fucks.
      I just always wanna be a baby around you. Cuddly baby who only wants hugs and kissess!!  
      <br> I want you to come to Hyderabad so that I can get that anytime and everytime. Uk firse lockdown lga toh where to go right? Try just try to come please. 
      <br> Time does not matter - even if its just 3 months. Still for me you are a big part of my life. Just want this to not change and stay like this and grow.
      <br> I do feel you deserve itna jitna I do and even more so be ready for more sweetness and bigger heart attacks in the evening tomorrow.
      <br> I hope you like this.<br>
      I wish you nothing but the best possible things the world has to offer. 
      <br>
      <b>Happy Birthday Momo :)</b>
